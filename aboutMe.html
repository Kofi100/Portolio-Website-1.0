        <!-- <p></p> -->
         I am someone who is passionate about tech,especially about <strong>programming software</strong>  and making easy-to-use <strong>User Interfaces</strong>  that
         would enable other tech/computer users to easily complete a task <strong>without going through a headache</strong>.
         <br><br>I also like to try to create apps that at the end of the day would prove <strong>useful to anyone who uses it</strong> and maybe eventually myself.
         <br><br>During my free time not programming or helping out do chores/jobs at home, I often watch YouTube videos about some tech tips,tech news,
         and also gaming videos especially about my favourite franchises like Megaman X,Sonic or Terraria. 
         <br><br>I also play games like Terraria and try to
         think of solutions to bugs I face in my code. I also read some books too.
