        <!-- <p></p> -->
        <!-- I am someone who is passionate about tech,especially about <strong>programming software</strong>  and making easy-to-use <strong>User Interfaces</strong>  that
         would enable other tech/computer users to easily complete a task <strong>without going through a headache</strong>.
         <br><br>I also like to try to create apps that at the end of the day would prove <strong>useful to anyone who uses it</strong> and maybe eventually myself.
         <br><br>During my free time not programming or helping out do chores/jobs at home, I often watch YouTube videos about some tech tips,tech news,
         and also gaming videos especially about my favourite franchises like Megaman X,Sonic or Terraria. 
         <br><br>I also play games like Terraria and try to
         think of solutions to bugs I face in my code. I also read some books too. -->


        I am a tech enthusiast with a strong passion for <strong>programming</strong> and <strong>creating intuitive
            user interfaces</strong>.
        <br><br>My goal is to design software and applications that <strong>simplify</strong> tasks for users, ensuring
        <strong>a seamless and headache-free experience</strong>.
        <br><br>I enjoy developing apps that are not only functional but also <strong>add value to people's lives,
            including my own</strong> .
        <br><br><strong>Problem-solving</strong> is at the core of what I do, and I find <strong>inspiration</strong>
        even in the challenges I encounter, like debugging code or optimizing user experiences.
        <br><br>When I’m not coding or helping with chores, I spend my time exploring tech trends, gaming, or watching
        YouTube videos on tech tips, news, and gaming—especially about my favorite franchises like Megaman X, Sonic, or
        Terraria.
        <br><br>Gaming also helps me unwind and sometimes sparks ideas for solving coding challenges.
        <br><br>I also enjoy reading books, expanding my knowledge, and thinking of new ways to innovate and grow as a
        developer.
